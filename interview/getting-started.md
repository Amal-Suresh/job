## Update Resume

Make sure your resume is up-to-date and includes all relevant experience for a JavaScript developer position.

Here are a few key points to consider when updating a resume:

1. **Review your job history and accomplishments:** review your job history and think about your accomplishments and responsibilities in each role. This will help you identify any skills or experience that you can highlight on your resume.
2. **Use a clear, easy-to-read format:** Your resume should be easy to read and understand, with a clear and organized layout. Use headings and bullet points to break up the text and make it easier to scan.
3. **Customize your resume for each job:** It is important to tailor your resume to the specific job you are applying for.
4. **Use keywords:** Some companies use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to filter resumes, so it is important to include relevant keywords in your resume to increase your chances of being noticed.
5. **Proofread and edit:** Make sure to proofread and edit your resume carefully to catch any spelling or grammar errors. It can also be helpful to have someone else review your resume to catch any mistakes you might have missed.
6. **Update your education and certifications:** If you have completed any additional education or training since you last updated your resume.
7. **Consider adding any additional skills or experience:** If you have gained any new skills or experience since you last updated your resume, consider adding this information to your resume (language skills, technical skills, or professional development courses).

The structure of your resume will depend on your individual circumstances and the job you are applying for. However, there are a few key elements that should be included in most resumes:

1. **Summary or objective statement:** a summary or objective statement at the top of your resume can help give the reader a quick overview of your skills and experience.
2. **Stack/Skills:** a list of your skills, such as technical skills, language skills, or soft skills.
3. **Work experience:** a list of your previous jobs, including the job title, company name, tech stack, and dates of employment. You should also include a list of responsibilities and accomplishments for each role, _with a focus on your personal achievements_.
   :::tip
   If you have a short time experience in one company, it would be wise to combine it with another one.
   :::
4. **Education:** your highest degree and the name of the institution where you earned it. You should also list any additional education or training you have received, such as professional development courses or certifications.
5. **Additional information:** any additional information that you think is relevant to the job you are applying for, such as awards or honors, publications, or professional memberships, or hobbies (if you have something special).
6. **Contact information:** your phone number, email address or messenger contacts, and timezone/address optionally.

Most recruiters ask a static file of resume. If you use Google Docs, it's easy to export a PDF version of the resume. If you choose a self-hosted CV then it would be nice to take care of a simple way to export to PDF, for example, use can use a built-in JS method `window.print();`

## Push Resume

There are several places and ways you can push your CV to increase your chances of finding a job:

1. **Online job boards:** There are many online job boards that list job openings, such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor. You can create a profile on these platforms and upload your CV to make it visible to employers searching for candidates.
2. **Company websites:** Many companies have a careers or job openings section on their website where you can submit your CV and apply for open positions.
3. **Professional networks:** Networking can be a powerful tool in finding a job. You can reach out to people in your professional network, such as former colleagues, classmates, and industry professionals, to let them know you are looking for a job and ask if they know of any openings.
4. **Recruitment agencies:** Recruitment agencies work with companies to help fill open positions. You can contact a recruitment agency and submit your CV to be considered for job openings.
5. **Directly contact companies:** If you are interested in working for a specific company, you can reach out to them directly to inquire about open positions or to express your interest in working with them.

As the first step, start with **LinkedIn** (check guides about how to fill LinkedIn profile, set a desirable region - the first point a recruiter will look for you). Also, you can make auto following of recruiters. You will most likely be contacted within two weeks. Then find a couple of other channels besides LinkedIn.

:::tip
Your job profile it's the first look at you, so make it as engaging as possible. Think about it as a Promo Page.

## Show Soft Skills

Hooray üéâ HR wrote you and you have the first touch with company. In most cases, you will arrange a 15‚Äì30 minutes call during the week. The main goal for hr's is to validate your soft skills.

:::caution
One of the leading reasons candidates get rejected is poor soft skills
:::

There are a few key things you can do to present yourself well in an interview:

1. **Dress appropriately:** often wearing jeans, shirt, t-shirts. Wearing more formally may suggest a lack of confidence, inexperience, or an attempt to overcompensate. It is best to be true to yourself and dress in a way that is comfortable and reflects your personality.
2. **Show enthusiasm and smile:** It is important to show enthusiasm for the opportunity to interview and the position you are applying for. People who are confident and enthusiastic about a job opportunity tend to be happy and excited to participate in an interview.
3. **Be prepared to answer questions:** Be prepared to answer common interview questions, as well as any specific questions related to the position or company.

## General soft skill questions

### Tell me about yourself

Prepare a compelling, personalized story that you can share in a short amount of time (around 45 seconds) that highlights a unique aspect of your personality or experiences - _**build an elevator pitch for your personal brand**_.

:::tip
Avoid cliches. Be different.¬†**Be bold.**¬†Every single person who comes in as a _passionate, hard worker, excited about JavaScript_. This is your chance to¬†*set yourself apart.*¬†Don‚Äôt blow it.
:::

### Any "stumped" question

**_Real question:_**¬†*Do you know your limitations?*

Almost all interviewers will try to stump you with a question you don‚Äôt know the answer to. What they want to see is¬†*a quick ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù*

:::note
It‚Äôs OK if you don‚Äôt know everything.
:::

The biggest mistake I see people make is to try to answer a question they don‚Äôt know the answer to. They will struggle and stumble for agonizing, uncomfortable minutes. That creates a¬†*really bad impression*¬†and interview experience for both of you.

If you don‚Äôt know the answer, say _I don‚Äôt know._ It‚Äôs healthy. Employers would like to hear you say _I don‚Äôt know_ at least once in an interview.

:::tip
People feel good about themselves when they give something back, so if your interviewer has a chance to teach you something new, they‚Äôll subconsciously feel better about the interview experience.
:::

Saying _I don‚Äôt know_ can help you land the job!

### Tell me about a problem you encountered in the past, and how you solved it

The interviewer wants to know your answer on: _How well do you deal with challenges?_

For this question, we‚Äôre looking for your ability to identify and articulate the problem, diagnose the root cause, and come up with a good solution. Challenges can be technical, or human. This question is very common, so give it some thought before you go into the interview. Keep your explanation **_short and simple_**.

For practice, try writing each of those three points out using less than 140 characters, each, and memorize those talking points. Be prepared to offer more detail if the interviewer asks follow-up questions.

### Why do you want to work here? Or Tell me what you know about us

**_Real question:_**¬†*How excited are you about this company?*

If you‚Äôre not excited to work for the company, don‚Äôt waste your time with the interview. Find something you really are excited about and jump on that opportunity, instead. It‚Äôs much harder to do something you don‚Äôt want to do than it is to be true to yourself and pave your own trail.

If you really want the job, you should do a little research. Learn about the company, what they do, and why you might enjoy the job. Do you like the tech? The people? The challenge? What motivates you that they seem to be offering?

Your time is valuable. Don‚Äôt waste it on a company you can‚Äôt get excited about.

### Why did you leave your last job?

**_Real question:_**¬†*Do you have complaints?*

The way you answer this question can get you immediately rejected. Employers know that sometimes a company or a particular person at a company can be a bad fit. Sometimes the company just isn‚Äôt the right place for your next career step.

Other hidden questions are ‚Äúdo you have the emotional intelligence to put the past in the past and move on? And the good judgement not to drag out the dirty laundry for a potential new employer to see?‚Äù

The last thing you want to do is dwell on the problem or dive into too much detail. It can send a strong signal, ‚Äúthis candidate struggles to get past challenges and focus on the present.‚Äù

People are going to ask their curious questions, but if you go into too much detail or start bad-mouthing your previous employer, the current manager might start to think, _are they going to be talking like this about me at their next job?_

## Show Hard Skills

Here are a few tips for completing a testing task in a JavaScript developer interview:

1. Communicate your thought process: It is important to be able to explain your approach to solving the problem and the decisions you are making as you write code. Employers often want to understand how you think and problem-solve, so be sure to clearly communicate your thought process.
2. Test your code: Make sure to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it is working as expected. This may involve writing additional test cases or using debugging tools to identify and fix any issues.
3. Pay attention to code quality: In addition to solving the problem, it is important to write clean, efficient, and well-organized code. This may include following best practices for coding style, commenting your code, and using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
4. Don't be afraid to ask questions: If you are unsure about something or need clarification on the task, don't be afraid to ask questions. It is better to ask for help than to submit code that is not working correctly.

## Get feedback

There are a few ways you can get feedback on your performance in an interview:

1. **Ask the interviewer:** After your interview, you can ask the interviewer for feedback on your performance. They may be able to provide specific feedback on your strengths and areas for improvement.
2. **Request feedback from the HR representative:** If you have been in contact with an HR representative during the interview process, you can reach out to them to request feedback on your performance.
3. **Practice with a friend or mentor:** You can also ask a friend or mentor to simulate an interview with you and provide feedback on your performance. This can be a helpful way to get a fresh perspective and identify areas for improvement.
4. **Review your own performance:** Finally, you can review your own performance by reflecting on the interview and considering what went well and what you could have done differently. You can also review any notes or materials you prepared for the interview to see if there are any areas where you could improve.
