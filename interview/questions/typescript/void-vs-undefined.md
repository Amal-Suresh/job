# `void` vs `undefined`

In TypeScript, `void` is a type that represents the absence of a value. The `void` type is used to indicate that a function does not return a value, or that a variable or expression has no value.

On the other hand, `undefined` is a value that represents the absence of a value or a variable that has not been assigned a value. In JavaScript and TypeScript, `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value or a variable that has not been assigned a value.
