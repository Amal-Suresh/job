# What is `implement` clause?

It is used to specify that a class or an object implements an interface or a class. An interface is a type that defines a set of properties, methods, and events that a class or an object must have or must implement. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and it can define the structure and the behavior of the objects it creates.
