# What ts benefits you know?

Benefits of using TypeScript include:

1. **Static typing**: TypeScript adds optional static typing to JavaScript, which allows you to specify the types of variables, function arguments, and return values. This can help to catch type-related errors at compile time, rather than at runtime, and it can make the code easier to understand and debug.
2. **Improved code completion**: TypeScript provides improved code completion and IntelliSense in code editors and IDEs, which can help to make the code easier to write and navigate.
3. **Improved code documentation**: TypeScript allows you to add type annotations and documentation comments to the code, which can help to make the code more self-explanatory and easier to understand.
4. **Improved code refactoring**: TypeScript's static typing and improved code completion and IntelliSense can make it easier to refactor and modify the code, as it can help to catch errors and provide suggestions for alternatives.
