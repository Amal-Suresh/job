# What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language that is based on JavaScript, and it is designed to add optional static typing and other features to JavaScript. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code, and TypeScript adds additional features and syntax to the language.
