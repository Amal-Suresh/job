# What is enum and why to use?

`enum` is a way to define a set of related values that can be used to represent a specific set of choices or options. An `enum` is a named group of constants, and it allows you to create a set of named values that can be used to represent a specific set of choices or options.

The purpose of using an `enum` in TypeScript is to create a named group of constants that can be used to represent a specific set of choices or options. An `enum` can help to make the code more readable and maintainable by providing a clear and concise way to represent a set of related values, and it can help to enforce a consistent and standardized approach to using these values in the code.

An `enum` can also be used to create a set of related values that can be used as keys or indexes in an array or an object, or as arguments or parameters in a function or a method. An `enum` can be used to create a set of values that can be used in a more structured and organized way, and it can help to avoid errors and inconsistencies in the code.
