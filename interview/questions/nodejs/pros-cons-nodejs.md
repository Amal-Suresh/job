-   Easy scalability of using microservices and NPM packages as ready-made solutions library
-   Single language for frontend and backend development
-   Single language for cross-platform development (web, desktop, mobile)

-   Reduces performance when handling Heavy Computing Tasks
-   Frequent changes of main NodeJS API
