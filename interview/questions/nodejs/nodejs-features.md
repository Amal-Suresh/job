# What are the key features of NodeJS?

-   **Asynchronous and Event driven** – All APIs of Node.js are asynchronous. This feature means that if a Node receives a request for some Input/Output operation, it will execute that operation in the background and continue with the processing of other requests. Thus, it will not wait for the response from the previous requests.
-   **Fast in Code execution** – Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript Runtime engine, the one which is used by Google Chrome. Node has a wrapper over the JavaScript engine which makes the runtime engine much faster and hence processing of requests within Node.js also become faster.
-   **Single Threaded but Highly Scalable** – Node.js uses a single thread model for event looping. The response from these events may or may not reach the server immediately. However, this does not block other operations. Thus making Node.js highly scalable. Traditional servers create limited threads to handle requests while Node.js creates a single thread that provides service to much larger numbers of such requests.
-   **There is an Active and vibrant community for the Node.js framework** – The active community always keeps the framework updated with the latest trends in the web development.
-   **No Buffering** – Node.js applications never buffer any data. They simply output the data in chunks.
- **Single language** for frontend and backend development and cross-platform development (web, desktop, mobile).
- **NPM** - repository with huge amount of libraries, helps to find various solutions.
