# What is the diff synchronous vs asynchronous code?

Synchronous code is executed in a blocking manner, meaning that the program will pause at each synchronous line of code until the operation is complete.

Asynchronous code is executed in a non-blocking manner, allowing the program to continue running while the asynchronous operation is being performed.
