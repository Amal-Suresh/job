# What are portals in React?

_Portal_Â is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
```

The first argument is any render-able React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument is a DOM element.
