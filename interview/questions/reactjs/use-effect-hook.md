# What is `useEffect` hook?

The useEffect hook is used for performing side effects in functional components. This can include things like data fetching, setting up subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. The useEffect hook is called after the component renders, and can be used to ensure that your component stays up-to-date with any relevant data or dependencies.
