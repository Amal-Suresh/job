# What is Asynchronous execution?

Asynchrony implies that an operation can be performed by someone on the side: a remote Web site, a server, or another device outside the current computing device.

The main property of such operations is that the start of such an operation requires significantly less time than the main operation. This allows many asynchronous operations to be performed simultaneously, even on a device with a small number of computing devices.
