# What is OOP?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures that contain data and behavior. In OOP, the focus is on creating objects that represent real-world entities and the relationships between them, rather than on writing code to perform specific tasks.

OOP is based on the idea of encapsulation, which means that an object's data and behavior are bundled together and hidden from the outside world. This allows objects to be self-contained and modular, and it makes it easier to reuse and maintain the code.

OOP also introduces the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, which allow objects to inherit characteristics and behavior from other objects, and to exhibit different behavior in different contexts.

OOP is widely used in modern programming languages, and it is a powerful paradigm that can help to structure and organize the code, and to make it more modular, reusable, and maintainable.
