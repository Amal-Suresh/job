# What is SOLID?

SOLID is a set of five principles of object-oriented software design. These principles were first proposed by Robert C. Martin in the early 2000s and have since become a widely accepted set of best practices for designing maintainable, scalable, and flexible software systems.

**The five principles of SOLID are:**
1.  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, and that it should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
2.  Open-Closed Principle (OCP): This principle states that a class should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that it should be easy to add new functionality to a class, but the existing code should not need to be modified.
3.  Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle states that a subclass should be able to be used as a substitute for its superclass, without altering the correctness of the program.
4.  Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): This principle states that a client should not depend on interfaces it does not use. This means that a class should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods.
5.  Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather both should depend on abstractions. This helps to decouple the modules and makes them more flexible and maintainable.

By following the SOLID principles, developers can design software systems that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend over time.
