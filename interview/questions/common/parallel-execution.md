# What is Parallel execution?

Parallel execution (parallel computing) implies having more than one computing device (e.g., a processor) that will perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

Parallel execution is a strict subset of competitive execution. This means that on a computer with one processor, parallel programming is impossible.
