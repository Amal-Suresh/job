# Why is it better to leave the global scope "as is" and not touch it?

The global scope in JavaScript is the default scope that is available to all scripts and functions, and it is represented by the global object (e.g., `window` in the browser).

Modifying the global scope by adding or modifying variables and functions can lead to potential conflicts with existing variables and functions, as well as with future code that may depend on the original values of these variables and functions.

Additionally, modifying the global scope can make the code more difficult to understand and maintain, as it can be harder to track the source and purpose of variables and functions that are added to the global scope.

To avoid these problems, it is generally a good practice to use a local scope for variables and functions, and to avoid modifying the global scope whenever possible. This helps to keep the code organized, maintainable, and less prone to conflicts and errors.
