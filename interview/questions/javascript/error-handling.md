# How do you handle errors in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, there are a few ways to handle errors:

1. Try-catch statement: The try-catch statement is a built-in feature of JavaScript that can be used to handle errors in the code. The try-catch statement consists of a try block that contains the code that may throw an error, and a catch block that contains the code that handles the error.
2. Throwing custom errors: In JavaScript, you can throw custom errors by using the `throw` keyword and an instance of the `Error` class. This can be useful if you want to create and throw specific types of errors in the code.
3. Using the `onerror` event handler: The `onerror` event handler is a built-in event handler that can be used to handle errors in JavaScript. It is called whenever an error occurs in the code, and it can be used to display an error message or to log the error.

Handling errors helps to prevent the code from breaking and to ensure that the code runs smoothly and efficiently. Also it allows you to provide meaningful feedback to the users of your code, and to identify and fix problems in the code.
