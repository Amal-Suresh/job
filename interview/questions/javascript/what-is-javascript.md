# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to create interactive elements on websites. It is a client-side language, which means that the code is executed by the user's web browser rather than on a server. JavaScript can be used to create a wide variety of effects and features on a website, such as drop-down menus, form validation, and interactive maps.

JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it uses objects and their properties and methods to represent and manipulate data. It also supports other programming paradigms, such as functional programming.
