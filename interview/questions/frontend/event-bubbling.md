# What is Event Bubbling?

Event bubbling is a type of event propagation that occurs during the bubbling phase. When an event is triggered on an element, it is propagated up to its parent elements, until it reaches the top of the document. Event bubbling allows you to handle events on multiple elements that are nested inside each other.
