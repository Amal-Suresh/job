# What is responsive design, and how do you implement it in CSS?

Responsive design is a design approach that is used to create web sites and applications that are adaptable and flexible, and that work well on different devices and screen sizes. Responsive design is based on the concept of fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries.

To implement responsive design in CSS, you can use the following techniques:
- Use relative units, such as percentages or viewport units, to define the dimensions and the positions of the elements.
- Use media queries to apply different styles based on the size and the dimensions of the viewport.
- Use flexible layouts, such as block layout or flexbox layout, to create flexible and adaptable layouts that adjust to the size and the dimensions of the viewport.
-  Use flexible images, by using the "max-width" property or the "object-fit" property, to make the images adapt to the size and the dimensions of the viewport.
