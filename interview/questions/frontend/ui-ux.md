# What is UI/UX?

**1) UI or User Interface**: is how a product or website is laid out and how you interact with it: Where the buttons are, how big the fonts are, and how menus are organized are all elements of UI.

**2) UX or User Experience**: is how you feel about using a product or a website. So, your love for the way the new Apple Watch looks or your excitement that there’s finally a tablet-sized iPhone to watch those Corgi videos you’re obsessed with are reflections of UX. So the new look of the Facebook news feed involves a change to UI, and the way you navigate that new page is the UX.
