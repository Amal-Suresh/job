# What is Event Capturing?

Event capturing is a type of event propagation that occurs during the capturing phase. When an event is triggered on an element, it is propagated down to its child elements, until it reaches the element that triggered the event. Event capturing allows you to handle events on multiple elements that are nested inside each other.
