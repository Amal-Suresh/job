# What is an Event Loop?

In JavaScript, the event loop is a mechanism that is used to execute code asynchronously. It is a loop that continuously checks for and processes events that are added to the event queue.

The event loop works in conjunction with the call stack and the task queue. The call stack is a data structure that is used to store the execution context of the code that is currently being executed. It is a stack of frames, with the most recently called function at the top of the stack.

The task queue is a data structure that is used to store tasks that are waiting to be executed. Tasks are added to the task queue when they are created, and they are removed from the task queue and added to the call stack when they are ready to be executed.

The event loop is responsible for checking the task queue and adding tasks to the call stack when they are ready to be executed. It runs continuously, and it processes tasks in the order in which they are added to the task queue.
