# Intro

The main goal of this guide is to get the best job offer you can. And start with main steps of common job seeking process called **job workflow**.

## Job workflow

Usually, the job workflow consists of the next steps

### Create a CV

Example of CV and good structure you can see by [following link](https://emil.pw).

The main points to look for:

-   title
-   description - the short summary about your status
-   career, focus on your achievements during role, mention tech stack
-   hobbies, specify it if you have something special
-   contact information

If you don't know where\how to deploy CV, I recommend using any [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/) and GitHub pages or the simplest way is Google Docs.

> Also, don't forget to make a PDF version of the CV.
>
> It's better if you can make it as easy as you can, for example use button with one method `window.print();`

### CV pushing

The best job board is LinkedIn IMHO. So it's better to start with it. Google guides about how to fill LinkedIn profile, select your region and make auto following of recruiters every day. You will most likely be contacted within two weeks.

Your job profile it's the first look of you, so make it as engaging as possible. Think about it as a Promo Page.

Find a couple of other channels besides LinkedIn. In my practice, the hr's contacted me on their own.

### First touch

Hooray! HR wrote to you - it's the first touch with company. In most cases, you will arrange a 15–30 minutes call during the week. The main goal for hr's is to validate your soft skills.

### Personal Intro

-   Last job: what likes/dislikes
-   Ask about common daily tasks and steps to handle with them
-   Ask about specific tasks and steps to handle with them
-   Ask about complex tasks and steps to handle with them
-   What candidate is looking for

### Testing Task \*

Some companies suggest making a testing task. It's up to you whether you want to do it or not.

### Interview

In most cases, it will be 1-2 programming interviews to discover your tech (hard) skills. But be ready to be tested 5–6 times.
