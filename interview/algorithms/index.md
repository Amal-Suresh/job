# Algorithms

:::info
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. It is a set of instructions or rules that can be followed to accomplish a specific task.

As a JavaScript developer, you can start learning algorithms by following these steps:

1.  **Learn the basics of JavaScript.** Before diving into algorithms, make sure you have a good understanding of the JavaScript language, including its syntax, data types, control structures, and built-in functions.
2.  **Study basic algorithms and data structures in JavaScript.** Start by learning about common algorithms and data structures that are commonly implemented in JavaScript, such as sorting algorithms (e.g. bubble sort, quick sort), searching algorithms (e.g. linear search, binary search), and data structures (e.g. arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees).
3.  **Practice solving problems using JavaScript.** Try solving coding challenges on websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeForces that allow you to use JavaScript as a solution.
4.  **Learn about JavaScript libraries and frameworks for implementing algorithms.** JavaScript has a number of libraries and frameworks such as D3.js and Chart.js, Tensorflow.js, etc. that can be used to implement various algorithms.
5.  **Dive deeper into specific areas of interest.** Once you have a solid understanding of basic algorithms and data structures, you can start exploring more specialized areas such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and graph algorithms using JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
6.  **Keep learning.** The field of algorithms is always evolving, so make sure you stay up-to-date with the latest developments by following blogs, articles, and other resources.

It's also worth noting that knowing JavaScript alone is not sufficient to understand the underlying mathematics of an algorithm and its implementation, so it is a good idea to brush up on the concepts of mathematics that are relevant to algorithms.

Here are the most basic definitions for **Algorithms Topic**:

### What is Time Complexity?

The time complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time the algorithm takes to run, as a function of the size of the input. Time complexity is typically expressed using **big O notation**, which describes the upper bound of the running time.

```js
function linearSearch(arr, target) {
	for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		if (arr[i] === target) {
			return i;
		}
	}
	return -1;
}
```

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the size of the array. This is because the worst-case time complexity occurs when the target is not in the array and we have to iterate through all n elements to confirm its absence.

### What is Space Complexity?

The space complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of memory the algorithm uses, as a function of the size of the input. Like time complexity, space complexity is also typically expressed using big O notation.

For example, consider the following function which takes a number and returns the nth Fibonacci number using recursion:

```js
function fibonacci(n) {
	if (n <= 1) {
		return n;
	}
	return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

The space complexity of this function is O(n) because each call to the fibonacci function creates a new function call on the call stack, and in the worst-case, we need to call the function n times in order to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

### What is Asymptotic Notation?

Asymptotic notation provides a way to describe how the time or space complexity of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. Commonly used asymptotic notations include big O, big omega and big theta, which provide upper and lower bounds on the growth of the running time.

### What is Data Structures?

A data structure is a specific way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory, such that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.

**Arrays**

```js
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

**Linked Lists**

```js
class Node {
	constructor(val) {
		this.val = val;
		this.next = null;
	}
}

class LinkedList {
	constructor() {
		this.head = null;
	}
}
```

**Stacks**

```js
class Stack {
	constructor() {
		this.stack = [];
	}

	push(val) {
		this.stack.push(val);
	}
	pop() {
		return this.stack.pop();
	}
	peek() {
		return this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
	}
}
```

**Queues**

```js
class Queue {
	constructor() {
		this.queue = [];
	}

	enqueue(val) {
		this.queue.push(val);
	}
	dequeue() {
		return this.queue.shift();
	}
	peek() {
		return this.queue[0];
	}
}
```

**Trees**

```js
class TreeNode {
	constructor(val) {
		this.val = val;
		this.left = null;
		this.right = null;
	}
}

class BinaryTree {
	constructor() {
		this.root = null;
	}
}
```

### What is Sorting?

Sorting is the process of arranging a collection of items in a particular order. Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and radix sort.

### What is Searching?

Searching is the process of finding an element in a collection of items. Common searching algorithms include linear search and binary search.

### What is Recursion?

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Recursive algorithms can be used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems of the same type.

### What is Greedy Algorithm?

A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes a locally optimal choice at each step, with the hope of finding a global optimal solution. This can lead to a highly efficient algorithm, but it doesn't always guarantee an optimal solution.

### What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, and solving each subproblem only once and storing the results for future use.

### What is Divide and Conquer?

Divide and conquer is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently. It's similar to the technique of recursion, but generally better for optimization problems.

### What is Backtracking?

Backtracking is a technique for solving problems by trying out different solutions, and undoing the steps of a solution that leads to failure.

### What is Graph algorithms?

Graph algorithms are a set of algorithms that operate on graph data structures. Some common graph algorithms include depth-first search, breadth-first search, shortest path algorithms and etc.

### What is Heuristics?

Heuristics are problem-solving strategies that are not guaranteed to find an optimal solution, but are often used to quickly find good solutions in practice.

### What is Approximation Algorithms?

Approximation algorithms are algorithms that are designed to find approximate solutions to optimization problems, rather than exact solutions.

### What is Randomized Algorithms?

Randomized algorithms are algorithms that incorporate randomness in their execution. They can be used for tasks such as searching, sorting, and optimization.
